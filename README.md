# HTML_CSS_Git

## Description

This project was created to refactor an existing Website of a marketing agency to make it more accesible and, consequently, rank higher in search engines.

Examined the starter code, the absence of semantic HTML elements was evident. Made a logical reorganization to the semantic structure of the HTML elements and CSS style.
